<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com){:target="\_blank"}. You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/){:target="\_blank"} and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/){:target="\_blank"}, like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->

I am a 4th year PhD student at the [Embedded and Networked Systems groups](https://www.tudelft.nl/ewi/over-de-faculteit/afdelingen/software-technology/embedded-and-networked-systems/) at the [Delft University of Technology](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/). My supervisors are [Professor Marco Zuniga](https://www.st.ewi.tudelft.nl/marco/) and [Professor Qing Wang](https://www.st.ewi.tudelft.nl/qing/).


<!-- My research interests also include exploiting physical knowledge to advance the learning process on embedded devices and developing privacy-preserved AIoT systems. -->
